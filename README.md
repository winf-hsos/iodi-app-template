This is a coding template for the course "Impacts of Digitalization" at the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabr√ºck. It helps to get started with simple programming tasks involving the Tinkerforge building blocks.

# Get started

In this course, we use Glitch as our coding environment Glitch allows us to create a new project from a GitHub repository.

**Step 1**: Copy the following URL: `https://github.com/winf-hsos/iodi-app-template.git`

**Step 2**: Sign in to Glitch and create a new project from GitHub.

**Step 3**: In the pop-up window, paste the URL from step 1 and click OK.

Glitch will import the app template into a new project. You now have a copy of the app template that you can change as needed.
